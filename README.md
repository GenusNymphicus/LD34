# LD34
This game was made for the LD34 with the themes "Two Button controls" and "Growing".
The game was written in a custom C++/OpenGL engine, using emscripten for the web export.

Your goal is to punch things and grow your meter. With each upgrade, your weapon will grow.
But so will your characters personality and timing his attacks becomes even more difficult.
